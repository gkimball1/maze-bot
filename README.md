## Overview
Sawyer is a single-arm robot intended for working alongside humans and for use in industrial settings. We used various strategies taught in Berkeley's Introduction to Robotics course to allow Sawyer to analyze a maze drawn on a whiteboard before drawing the solution on the same whiteboard. 
### Goal
Sawyer should precisely and accurately produce and draw a solution to a maze on a whiteboard. 
### Tasks to be Completed
Before Sawyer is able to complete the main task at hand, it must first be able solve a series of smaller tasks: 
1. Vision Processing
   - Sawyer must be able to translate a real-world image into a digitized data structure that is operable on by maze-solving algorithms
   - Sawyer must also be able to identify the start and end locations
2. Solving the Maze
   - Provided with a digitized image, Sawyer must compute the optimal path to move from the start position to the end position
3. Translation to Real World
   - Sawyer must be able to use the solved maze path to determine a list of 3D locations in the real world that its end gripper (to which the marker is attached) must move through to draw the desired solution. 
4. Motion & Final Solution
   - Sawyer must use various control laws and path planning to move through the proper locations and ultimately deposit the correct ink path solving the maze onto the whiteboard. 

### Applications
There are several applications of this that could be useful in industrial or household settings. Many deal with "soft" obstacles that aren't necessarily life-ending if the robot runs into them, but still present some suboptimality in the task at hand. 
- Having Sawyer recognize >= 2 containers and dispense something into them--say, dumping peanuts into some peanut jars in a peanut processing facility. 
  - Sawyer will begin at one peanut jar (the "start" point), dispense, move to another peanut jar (the end point), and dispense again. It is sub-optimal if is Sawyer is dispensing peanuts during the whole path between the first jar and the second jar. 
- Welding two plates of metal together. 
  - If Sawyer has a thermal arc torch attached to its hand, Sawyer can recognize the path of metal that needs to be welded together and use its maze-solving skills to trace the path with its end-effector and fuse the metal into one piece. 
  - Similarly, this can be used for laser-etching a 3d object...
  - ...or precisely cutting a piece of wood
- Moving packages around in a giant warehouse.
  - If Sawyer were a few orders of magnitude larger, it would be able to pick up a package, find a path through the warehouse that wouldn't knock over the preexisting stacks of apparel, and deposit the package in a place the package should be deposited in. @Amazon--we're open for hire. 

## Design
Ultimately, the design of this solution must be able to correctly and cleanly solve a whiteboard maze. It must be able to locate the whiteboard's location & orientation, the starting point, and the ending point, and from there be able to trace its end-effector over the proper path through the maze. 

We chose a whiteboard with a duct-taped maze and an AR tag located directly next to the start position. 

## Implementation
The implemented steps were:
1. Position Arm
   - The arm has to be positioned at height in order to have the arm camera fully process the maze and its position
2. Take a photo
   - A photo of the maze is taken and saved for further processing
3. Transform
   - A homographic transform is used to resize the image so it can be processed accurately
4. Solve
   - A simple BFS is used to determine the solution to the maze. Since this is a relatively small image and maze we can use BFS efficiently
   - Output a list of the most critical 3d points (corners) in space that the end-effector must pass through to draw out the solution
5. Draw Solution
   - Sawyer iterates through each of the points in the list outputted by the BFS program one-by-one and utilizes the linear path-planning algorithm to draw the final solution.
